1. An "Add" button in the AppBar (IconButton with + icon)
2. The _addOrEditInvestor method that opens the InvestorDetailView
3. Form validation in InvestorDetailView
4. Service method calls to add the investor
5. UI updates after adding an investor

The functionality is working as required, so no changes are needed to implement this feature since it's already properly implemented.
