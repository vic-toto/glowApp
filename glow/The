1. A FloatingActionButton that triggers the add event dialog when pressed
2. A fully implemented _showAddEventDialog method with all required form fields
3. Validation that ensures title is not empty before submission
4. Proper calls to the EventService to add events and update the calendar view
5. Dialog closing and event list refreshing on successful event creation

No changes are needed as the requested functionality is already implemented correctly in the codebase.
